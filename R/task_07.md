### NYCFlights13

Using the nycflights13::weather Determine whether there are any clear outliers in wind speed (wind\_speed) that should be rejected. If so, filter those bad point(s) and proceed. What direction has the highest median speed at each airport? Make a table and a plot of median wind speed by direction, for each airport.

It appears that common female babynames in recent years were significantly less common 50+ years ago. On the other hand, the most common male babynames were actually more common in the past than they are now,

0 is the pre-treatment mean distance for each line At each time point, the y-value is equal to the distance of the nucleus from the tip MINUS the pre-treatment mean distance When iT3 is treated with oryzalin, the variability in nuclear position increases more significantly than in WT.
